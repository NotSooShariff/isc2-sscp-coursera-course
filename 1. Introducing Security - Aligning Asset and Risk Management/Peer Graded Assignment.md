1. **An asset is worth $10,000. The likelihood of an attack is once every two years with an expected impact of 80% damage. The risk acceptance level is $2000. A control that would reduce the risk to $1000 per event is available at an annual cost of $4000. Should the company implement the control? Calculate SLE, ARO and ALE. Then calculate residual risk once the control is implemented.**

SLE = Single Loss Expectancy

ARO = Annualized Rate of Occurrence

ALE = Annual Loss Expectancy

SLE = 10000$ * 80% = 10000$ * 0.8 = 8000$

ARO = 100% in 2 years. Therefore, 50% in 1 year

ALE = ARO * SLE = 8000$ * 50% = 8000$ * 0.5 = 4000$

Reduced Risk per Event = 1000$

Therefore, Reduced ALE (after implementing control) = 1000$ * 0.5 = 500$

Residual Risk = Difference between ALE and Reduced ALE = 4000$ - 500$ = 3500$

Hence, the control should be at most 3500 $ per year. Otherwise, it won't be logical from a business perspective, that is we don’t want to spend more money than we can potentially lose. This is how cost/benefit analysis works.

Therefore, although the risk acceptance level will be met after implementing the control, the company will suffer a net loss.

Hence, the company should not implement the control.

2. **As a network service provider, XYZ Network Solutions provides high speed network services to many clients such as government, banks, and internet-based businesses. What is the primary security consideration for XYZ Network Solutions? Confidentiality? Availability? Integrity? How can the clients of XYZ Network Solutions assure themselves of acceptable levels of service?**

Just as there are many ways to infiltrate a network, there are many different techniques and strategies. Some of the most common types of network security solutions include:

Antivirus Software: Antivirus software can be installed on all network devices to scan them for malicious programs. It should be updated regularly to fix any issues or vulnerabilities

Encryption: Encryption is the process of scrambling data to the point of unintelligibility and providing only authorized parties the key (usually a decryption key or password) to decode it. This way, even if data is intercepted or seen by an unauthorized user, they are unable to read it.

Firewalls: Firewalls are a software program, hardware device or combination of both that blocks unsolicited traffic from entering a network. They can be configured to only block suspicious or unauthorized traffic, while still allowing access to legitimate requests.

Multi-Factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication is simple: users must provide two separate methods of identification to log into an account (for instance, typing in a password and then typing in a numeric code that was sent to another device). Users should present unique credentials from two out of three categories — something you know, something you have and something you are — for multi-factor authentication to be fully effective.

Network Segmentation: Network segmentation involves breaking down a larger network into various subnetworks or segments. If any of the subnetworks are infiltrated or compromised, the others are left untouched because they exist independently of each other.

One security strategy won’t be enough to fully and effectively protect a network. A combination of different techniques will ensure that your network is as secure as possible and will help to meet the unique needs of your organization.

 

Confidentiality

Confidentiality measures protect information from unauthorized access and misuse.  Most information systems house information that has some degree of sensitivity. It might be proprietary business information that competitors could use to their advantage, or personal information regarding an organization’s employees, customers or clients.

Confidential information often has value and systems are therefore under frequent attack as criminals hunt for vulnerabilities to exploit.  Threat vectors include direct attacks such as stealing passwords and capturing network traffic, and more layered attacks such as social engineering and phishing.  Not all confidentiality breaches are intentional. A few types of common accidental breaches include emailing sensitive information to the wrong recipient, publishing private data to public web servers, and leaving confidential information displayed on an unattended computer monitor.

Healthcare is an example of an industry where the obligation to protect client information is very high.  Not only do patients expect and demand that healthcare providers protect their privacy, there are strict regulations governing how healthcare organizations manage security.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) addresses security, including privacy protection, in the the handling of personal health information by insurers, providers and claims processors.  HIPAA rules mandate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, and require organizations to conduct risk analysis.

There are many countermeasures that organizations put in place to ensure confidentiality.  Passwords, access control lists and authentication procedures use software to control access to resources.  These access control methods are complemented by the use encryption to protect information that can be accessed despite the controls, such as emails that are in transit.  Additional confidentiality countermeasures include administrative solutions such as policies and training, as well as physical controls that prevent people from accessing facilities and equipment.

 

Integrity

Integrity measures protect information from unauthorized alteration.  These measures provide assurance in the accuracy and completeness of data.  The need to protect information includes both data that is stored on systems and data that is transmitted between systems such as email.  In maintaining integrity, it is not only necessary to control access at the system level, but to further ensure that system users are only able to alter information that they are legitimately authorized to alter.

As with confidentiality protection, the protection of data integrity extends beyond intentional breaches.  Effective integrity countermeasures must also protect against unintentional alteration, such as user errors or data loss that is a result of a system malfunction.

While all system owners require confidence in the integrity of their data, the finance industry has a particularly pointed need to ensure that transactions across its systems are secure from tampering.  One of the most notorious financial data integrity breaches in recent times occurred in February 2016 when cyber thieves generated $1-billion in fraudulent withdrawals from the account of the central bank of Bangladesh at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The hackers executed an elaborate scheme that included obtaining the necessary credentials to initiate the withdrawals, along with infecting the banking system with malware that deleted the database records of the transfers and then suppressed the confirmation messages which would have alerted banking authorities to the fraud.  After the scheme was discovered most of the transfers were either blocked or the funds recovered, but the thieves were still able to make off with more than $60-million.

There are many countermeasures that can be put in place to protect integrity.  Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorized users from making unauthorized changes.  Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted.  Equally important to protecting data integrity are administrative controls such as separation of duties and training.

 

Availability

In order for an information system to be useful it must be available to authorized users.  Availability measures protect timely and uninterrupted access to the system. Some of the most fundamental threats to availability are non-malicious in nature and include hardware failures, unscheduled software downtime and network bandwidth issues.  Malicious attacks include various forms of sabotage intended to cause harm to an organization by denying users access to the information system.

The availability and responsiveness of a website is a high priority for many business.  Disruption of website availability for even a short time can lead to loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and reputation damage.  The Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a method frequently used by hackers to disrupt web service. In a DoS attack, hackers flood a server with superfluous requests, overwhelming the server and degrading service for legitimate users.  Over the years, service providers have developed sophisticated countermeasures for detecting and protecting against DoS attacks, but hackers also continue to gain in sophistication and such attacks remain an ongoing concern.

Availability countermeasures to protect system availability are as far ranging as the threats to availability.  Systems that have a high requirement for continuous uptime should have significant hardware redundancy with backup servers and data storage immediately available.  For large, enterprise systems it is common to have redundant systems in separate physical locations. Software tools should be in place to monitor system performance and network traffic.  Countermeasures to protect against DoS attacks include firewalls and routers.

3. **What is the primary purpose of information classification?**

 Information classifications help prioritize data protection efforts to increase data security and regulatory compliance. Among its benefits are improved user productivity and decision-making and reduced costs by eliminating data that's not needed.

4. **What is meant by the term ‘non-repudiation’?**

 Non-repudiation is a legal concept that means a party can't deny sending or receiving a message or the authenticity of their signature on a document. It's one of the five pillars of information assurance, along with integrity, availability, authentication, and confidentiality.
