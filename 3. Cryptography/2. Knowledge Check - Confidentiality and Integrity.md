1. Question 1
Confidentially is a duty of care that an organization owes to its employees, clients, customers and itself. Furthermore, often it is mandated under legal or regulatory requirements. A failure to protect data can have serious consequences for the individuals concerned and, by extension, to the business. A failure in confidentiality can result in financial, emotional or reputational harm. If such harm can be demonstrated, then the business itself suffers, in the form of fines, loss of reputation, loss of business or market share, etc. There is much to consider when it comes to confidentiality, such as healthcare records and financial records, and what about information pertaining to national security? 

Integrity pertains to protecting information from unauthorized or incorrect modification. Incorrect financial records might result in an individual being denied a loan or mortgage. Incorrect healthcare records could result in injury or loss of life. If a country collects information vital to protect its citizens and that information is wrong, what then?
