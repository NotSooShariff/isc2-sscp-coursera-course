1. Question 1
You are working for a public utility company that provides retail energy services to residential and business consumers. The company is evaluating proposals for smart metering systems that would use mobile phone technologies to send information from the meter to central processors for billing. Some of the people on your team argue that the data links from these smart meters do not need to use encryption, as this will add extra cost to the overall system. How would you respond? (D5, L3.1) 

- [ ] Our application doesn’t really need the security, but consumers and regulators will appreciate the added security. 
- [x] We do need to protect both the identity of the consumer, their account information, and their usage data, so that’s a good reason to include it in the design. 
- [ ] We don’t need to worry about data integrity, and only the meter installers or our maintainers will have physical access to the metering equipment, so we don’t really need encryption.
- [ ] There are no laws requiring it, so let’s not spend the money on including it or the hassle of managing hundreds of thousands of keys for all those consumer devices.

2. Question 2
What does non-repudiation ensure about an email message? (D5, L3.1)
